This code shows how to generate a hash of a string of data. Hashes are extremely useful for determining whether a transmission or file has been altered.  This code demonstrates two algorithms.  One outputs a 128 bit (16 byte) hash, and the other a 160 bit (20 byte) hash.  No matter what the length of input data, the hash will be a fixed length and will be unique for that string of data.
